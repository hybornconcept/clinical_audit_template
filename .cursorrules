Here’s the updated `.cursorrules` in an essay format, tailored for your use case with **Svelte 5**, **SvelteKit**, **TypeScript**, **SuperForms** for form management, **shadcn-svelte** for the UI, and **PocketBase** as the backend:

### **Introduction**
In modern web development, building a multi-step form with validation and seamless backend integration requires a structured approach. By leveraging **Svelte 5**, **SvelteKit**, **TypeScript**, **SuperForms**, **shadcn-svelte**, and **PocketBase**, you can create a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application. This essay outlines the key principles, best practices, and steps to achieve this goal.

### **Key Principles**

#### **1. Code Style and Structure**
A well-organized codebase is essential for scalability and maintainability. Use a modular, component-based architecture to break down the application into reusable pieces. For example, separate the form steps into individual components (`Step1.svelte`, `Step2.svelte`, etc.) and manage shared state in a parent component or store. TypeScript should be used extensively to ensure type safety and improve developer experience. Define interfaces or types for form data, API responses, and state to avoid runtime errors.

#### **2. Naming Conventions**
Consistent naming conventions improve readability and collaboration. Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MultiStepForm.svelte`) and camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `formData`, `validateForm`). Prefix utility functions with `use` to indicate their purpose (e.g., `useFormValidation`).

#### **3. Svelte 5 Runes**
Svelte 5 introduces powerful reactivity primitives like `$state`, `$derived`, and `$effect`. Use `$state` for managing form state across steps, `$derived` for computed values (e.g., progress indicators), and `$effect` for side effects like logging or analytics. These runes simplify state management and make your code more declarative.

#### **4. UI and Styling with shadcn-svelte**
**shadcn-svelte** provides a modern, customizable design system for building UIs. Use its pre-built components like `Form`, `Input`, `Button`, and `Label` to ensure consistency across the application. Follow **shadcn-svelte**’s color conventions and design guidelines to create a visually appealing interface. Customize styles as needed, but avoid overrides that break the design system.

#### **5. SuperForms for Form Management**
**SuperForms** is a powerful library for managing forms in SvelteKit. It simplifies form handling, validation, and submission. Use it to:
   - Define form schemas using `zod` for validation.
   - Manage form state and errors across steps.
   - Handle form submissions and integrate with PocketBase.

#### **6. PocketBase Integration**
PocketBase is a lightweight backend solution for storing and managing data. Use its JavaScript SDK to interact with your database. Initialize the PocketBase client in your project and use it to submit form data on the final step. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed submissions.

### **Steps to Build the Application**

#### **1. Project Setup**
Start by creating a new SvelteKit project with TypeScript support. Install the necessary dependencies, including **shadcn-svelte**, **SuperForms**, `zod`, and the PocketBase SDK. Set up PocketBase locally or use a hosted instance, and create a collection to store form data.

#### **2. Plan the Multi-Step Form**
Break the form into logical steps (e.g., Personal Info, Address, Confirmation). Define the fields for each step and how data will flow between them. Use a parent component to manage the current step and handle navigation.

#### **3. Create Form Components**
Create separate Svelte components for each step (`Step1.svelte`, `Step2.svelte`, etc.). Use **shadcn-svelte** components to build the UI for each step. Pass form data and navigation callbacks (`onNext`, `onPrev`) to each step component.

#### **4. Manage Form State with SuperForms**
Use **SuperForms** to manage form state and validation. Define a `zod` schema for each step and validate the data before allowing the user to proceed. Display validation errors using **shadcn-svelte**’s `FormMessage` component.

#### **5. Handle Navigation Between Steps**
Track the current step in the parent component and conditionally render the appropriate step component. Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between steps. Disable the "Next" button if the current step’s data is invalid.

#### **6. Submit Data to PocketBase**
On the final step, collect all the form data and submit it to PocketBase using the SDK. Handle submission errors and display feedback to the user. Show a success message or redirect the user after successful submission.

#### **7. Style the Form**
Use **shadcn-svelte**’s pre-built styles and components to ensure a consistent look. Customize styles as needed, but avoid breaking the design system. Ensure the form is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.

#### **8. Test the Application**
Test form validation, data submission, and edge cases (e.g., incomplete form submission, network errors). Use automated testing tools to ensure the application works as expected.

#### **9. Deploy the Application**
Build the SvelteKit app for production and deploy it to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server. Use environment variables to manage configuration settings.

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. **Progress Indicators**:
   - Show a progress bar or step indicators to inform users of their progress.

2. **Save Drafts**:
   - Allow users to save their progress and resume later.

3. **Animations**:
   - Use Svelte transitions to animate between steps.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the form is accessible by using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.

5. **Internationalization (i18n)**:
   - Use **Paraglide.js** to support multiple languages and RTL layouts.

### **Conclusion**
By following these principles and steps, you can build a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly multi-step form in SvelteKit. Leveraging **SuperForms** for form management, **shadcn-svelte** for the UI, and **PocketBase** for the backend ensures a seamless development experience and a high-quality end product. Keep your code organized, test thoroughly, and prioritize user experience to create an application that stands out.

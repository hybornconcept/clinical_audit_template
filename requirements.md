By following the steps below , you’ll have a clean, maintainable, and user-friendly multi-step form in your SvelteKit app using shadcn-svelte for the UI and PocketBase for the backend.


1. Project Setup
Create a SvelteKit Project:

Initialize a new SvelteKit project with TypeScript support.

Install shadcn-svelte:

Set up shadcn-svelte for your UI components. Follow the official documentation to configure it.

Install PocketBase SDK:

Add the PocketBase JavaScript SDK to your project.

Set Up PocketBase:

Run PocketBase locally or use a hosted instance.

Create a collection in PocketBase to store the form data.

2. Plan the Multi-Step Form
Define Form Steps:

Break the form into logical steps (e.g., Step 1: Personal Info, Step 2: Address, Step 3: Confirmation).

Design the Form Structure:

Plan the fields for each step and how the data will flow between steps.

3. Create Form Components
Create a Parent Component:

This component will manage the current step and handle navigation between steps.

Create Individual Step Components:

Create a separate Svelte component for each step (e.g., Step1.svelte, Step2.svelte, Step3.svelte).

Use shadcn-svelte Components:

Use shadcn-svelte components like Form, Input, Button, and Label to build the UI for each step.

4. Manage Form State
Use a Centralized Store:

Use a Svelte store or a parent component to manage the form state across steps.

Pass Data Between Steps:

Pass the form data and navigation callbacks (e.g., onNext, onPrev) to each step component.

5. Implement Form Validation
Define Validation Schemas:

Use a validation library like zod to define schemas for each step.

Validate Data Before Proceeding:

Validate the form data before allowing the user to move to the next step.

Display Validation Errors:

Use shadcn-svelte components like FormMessage to show validation errors.

6. Handle Navigation Between Steps
Track Current Step:

Use a variable to track the current step in the parent component.

Add Navigation Controls:

Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between steps.

Disable the "Next" button if the current step’s data is invalid.

Conditionally Render Steps:

Render the appropriate step component based on the current step.

7. Submit Data to PocketBase
Initialize PocketBase Client:

Set up the PocketBase client in your project.

Submit Data on Final Step:

On the final step, collect all the form data and submit it to PocketBase.

Handle Submission Errors:

Display an error message if the submission fails.

Show Success Feedback:

Display a success message or redirect the user after successful submission.

8. Style the Form
Use shadcn-svelte Styling:

Leverage the pre-built styles and components from shadcn-svelte for a consistent look.

Customize as Needed:

Add custom styles if necessary to match your design requirements.

Ensure Responsiveness:

Make sure the form looks good on all screen sizes.

9. Test the Application
Test Form Validation:

Ensure validation works correctly for each step.

Test Data Submission:

Verify that data is successfully submitted to PocketBase.

Test Edge Cases:

Test scenarios like incomplete form submission, network errors, etc.

10. Deploy the Application
Build the App:

Build your SvelteKit app for production.

Deploy to a Hosting Service:

Deploy your app to a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server.

11. Optional Enhancements
Add Progress Indicators:

Show a progress bar or step indicators to inform users of their progress.

Save Drafts:

Allow users to save their progress and resume later.

Add Animations:

Use Svelte transitions to animate between steps.

Optimize for Accessibility:

Ensure the form is accessible by using proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
